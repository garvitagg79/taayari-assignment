Taayari App Assignment:
This app assignment is made up in the React Native expo. This app contains a full functional test quiz functionality where user can take a test and check their aptitude according to that.

The app contains a submit button as well as a check solution button to check solution and the app is fully responsive to all screen sizes.

The app fetches the question data through a database library of react native known as Sqlite3. The data gets downloaded into the user system when a user opens the app for the first time. Through SQL queries, we can also, store the user input in separate tables as well. The current data is static so using a static database is more viable than using a dynamic database to reduce cost.
