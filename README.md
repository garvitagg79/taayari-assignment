Taayari App Assignment:
This app assignment is made up in the React Native expo. This app contains a full functional test quiz functionality where user can take a test and check their aptitude according to that.

The app contains a submit button as well as a check solution button to check solution and the app is fully responsive to all screen sizes.

The app fetches the question data through a database library of react native known as Sqlite3. The data gets downloaded into the user system when user opens the app for the first time. Through SQL queries, we can also, store the user input in separate tables as well. The current data is static so using a static database is more viable than using a dynamic database to reduce cost.
